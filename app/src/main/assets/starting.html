<p>The application D/L calculator, calculates Duckworth-Lewis <nobr>(D/L)</nobr> par scores and targets for rain-interrupted limited-overs cricket
matches. The 'Standard Edition' of the <nobr>D/L</nobr> method, described on the <a
href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-rules-and-regulations">ICC website</a>, is used.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not the same as the 'D/L/S' that is used in international matches
and domestic matches between first-class teams after November-2014. Use of the D/L/S requires proprietary software which
is not yet available to the general public (see FAQ 2 in the ICC FAQs. However, this application will provide a good indicator
of the state of play in a match, and the Standard Edition is also valid in professional matches where the
D/L/S software is not available.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>When you open th application, first page indicate team 1.Team 1 is the team which bats first. In the Innings 1 page, two pieces of information are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overs available to Team 1 at the start of its innings
<ul>
<li>The maximum number of overs permitted is 50</li>
<li>This may be less than the number of overs originally scheduled, if a rain interruption occurred before the start
of the match</li>
</ul><br>
<li>Team 1's final score</li>
<ul>
<li>The number of wickets in hand at the end of the innings is not used in the calculation</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The rain could interrupt the match in middle of a inning. Click <a href="interruptions.html">Add interruption</a><</p>

<h2>Innings 2</h2>
<p>To generate a target for Team 2 to score in their innings, only one piece of information is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of overs available to Team 2 at the start of its innings</li>
<ul>
<li>This also cannot be greater than 50</li>
<li>By default, this is assumed to be 50
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The rain could again interrupt the match in middle of a inning. Click <a href="interruptions.html">Add interruption</a><</p>

<p>If Team 2's innings has started, and you wish to calculate the par score for the current stage in the game (e.g.
    to see which team would win if the match were abandoned now), two further pieces of information are required:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The number of overs played so far by Team 2</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This can be a whole number of overs, or can include part of an over
        <li>Enter part overs using the standard notation - i.e. 42.4 overs means 42 overs, 4 balls</li>
        <li>If not specified, this will adjust itself by adding all overs played in antecedent interruption</li>
    </ul><br>
    <li>The number of wickets lost so far by Team 2</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If not specified, this will adjust itself to wicket lost till last interruptions
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Press 'Calculate' to calculate Team 2's revised target and par score.</p>

<p>When you press 'Calculate', the current par score will be shown above the target for the innings. If the match
were to be abandoned at this stage, if Team 2's score equalled the par score, the match would be tied. If Team 2's
score beats the par score, Team 2 wins. If it is lower than the par score, Team 1 wins.</p>
<p>Then click 'Generate Par Table' button which will populate a table which indicates how the par score with
increase in subsequent overs, and how it would increase if further wickets are lost.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Team 1 has 50 overs and scores 248. Then, a rain interruption during the innings break means that Team 2 will only
have 40 overs in their innings. Enter this information:
<ul>
<li>Innings 1 </li>
<ul>
<li>Overs available at start: 50</li>
<li>Team 1 final score: 248</li>
</ul>
<li>Innings 2 </li>
<ul>
<li>Overs available at start: 38</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>then press 'Calculate'. This shows that the target, off 38 overs, is 216.</p>
<p>If Team 2 have batted 10.3 overs, and have lost 2 wickets,but rain hav interrupted the game which made lost of 5 overs then add the following information by clicking interrptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Interruptios</li>
<ul>
<li>overs played: 10.3</li>
<li>Wickets lost: 2</li>
<li>overs lost: 5</li>
<p>then press 'done' button</p>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Press 'Calculate'. The par score at 10.3 overs at lost of 2 wickects is 56.</p>
<p>The 'Generate Par Tale' tab will show that at the end of the previous over (the 10th), the par score was 56/2. At the end of this
over, the par score rises to 58/2 (and then 62/2 off 12 overs). If Team 2 loses another wicket, then at the end of
the 11th over the par score is 67/3.</p>
